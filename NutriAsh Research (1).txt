National Organic Agriculture Policy
Agriculture is a primary sector that serves as the main source of livelihood and 
provides employment to about 66% of Ugandan population. The agriculture sector is 
a significant contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) — 24.5% — while being 
critical for food and income security. Achieving food and nutritional security and 
alleviation of poverty continues to pose a formidable challenge for the Government of 
Republic of Uganda (GoU). To address this challenge, Government through the Ministry 
of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries and key stakeholders emphasizes both 
conventional and organic agriculture systems to enhance agricultural production.
Over the last decade, the global production and trade in Organic Agriculture has been 
expanding exponentially. The unfolding market opportunities globally especially in the 
developed countries of Europe and North America, shifts in consumer preferences to 
safe and hazard free organic food, increasing consciousness about conservation of 
the environment as well as health hazards associated with agrochemicals are some 
of the major factors for the growing interest in Organic Agriculture.
Uganda’s agriculture system is by default largely organic due to the very minimal 
use of external inputs like inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. The use of chemical 
fertilizers is among the lowest in the world while the use of plant protection chemical 
is highly regulated. This situation presents a huge potential to promote Organic 
Agriculture, both for increased and sustainable food production to safeguard food 
security as well as for enhanced income for the farmers. 
ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Organic agriculture is a holistic production management system which aims to 
avoid the use of synthetic and harmful pesticides, fertilizers, growth regulators, and 
livestock feed additives to reach a long term goal of sustainable production of crops 
and animals.
Overall Organic Agriculture aims to promote, propagate a competitive and sustainable 
organic sub sector that contributes to: 
* Better farm incomes and sustainable livelihood; increased farm productivity, reduced expenses on external farm inputs, and reduction of poverty in the rural areas;
* Improved health of farmers, consumers and the public in general, environmental protection, enhanced soil fertility and farm biodiversity, reduced pollution and destruction of the environment as well as prevention of further depletion of natural resources; and 
* Disaster risk reduction and resilience to climate change, improved resiliency to disaster risks and climate change vulnerabilities caused by human interventions and naturally induced hazards. 
ORGANIC AGRICULTURE SUB-SECTOR IN UGANDA
Agriculture has been and continues to be the most important sector in Uganda’s 
economy in terms of food and nutritional security, employment, income, raw materials 
for industry and exports to regional and international markets. Globally, Uganda 
is believed to be one of the organic countries. There are 58 million hectares under 
Organic Agriculture and Uganda has only 262,282Ha. In Africa, Uganda is second to 
Tanzania with 268,729 ha in organic agricultural land (World of Organic Agriculture 
Report 2018). Worldwide, in terms of number of organic farms, Uganda occupies 
fourth position after Italy, Indonesia and Mexico. With 210,352 certified farmers, 
producing 115,062 tons of organic produce, Uganda is one of the countries with the 
highest comparative advantage for organic production in Africa.
The size of certified farms ranges between 0.5 ha and 4 ha. The number of certified 
farms represents about 1% of the total amount of agriculture land in the country. 
Some of the factors that favour organic farming in Uganda compared to other East 
African counties include: (i) adequate land and water for agricultural production, (ii) 
high potential for increasing production and productivity, and (iii) high export potential 
for organic products to regional and global markets.
The value of organic produce globally is estimated at USD 15.6 billion as of 2016. 
Even with its vintage second position with the number of organic farmers, Uganda 
meets less than 5% of the global organic market. Organic Agriculture contributes 
approximately USD 50m accounting for 17.1% of the value of agricultural exports 
which currently stand at USD 291.2m per annum ((MoFPED, 2017/18). 
The global trading environment and demand for organic produce in Europe and 
the United States of America provides a clear impetus for stimulating Organic 
Agriculture in Uganda. The Country has a huge potential for producing food crops 
(including fruits), cash crops (including coffee, tea, and cotton), as well as organic 
livestock to meet the increasing global demand for Organic products. Uganda has 
the potential to put over 500,000 ha of land under Organic Agriculture and certify over 
500,000 farmers once the sub sector is better regulated and facilitated. This would 
see Uganda’s volume of organic produce increase from the current 115,062 Mt to 
210,000 Mt

Components of wood ash

Wood ash mainly contains calcium or calcium oxide, known as quicklime. This can account for up to 45 percent. Magnesium and potassium are also present, as well as phosphorus pentoxide. Iron, manganese, sodium and other mineral trace elements can also be found. If the wood ash originates from treated wood, heavy metals may also remain in it. These are, for example, lead and chromium as well as cadmium – as fertilizer a toxic cocktail for plants and animals.
* Unsuitable fuel for fertilizer ash
* Hard coal
* Lignite
* Pellets
* Tobacco
* briquettes
* impregnated garden wood such as fence posts, poles or old terrace wood
* treated wooden furniture
* chipboard
* panelling
* treated recycled wood
* varnished, glued, stained wood
* color printed paper, catalogs
* cardboard
* glossy paper
You may fertilize these plants with wood ash


As a general rule, you should refrain from using ash from fuel of unknown origin as fertilizer. If there are pollutants in it and you fertilize your vegetables with it, you will absorb the toxins yourself via this detour. In general, ash benefits plants that require alkaline or neutral soils as their location. First and foremost, these are fruit trees and vegetable plants. However, some ornamental plants also tolerate ash:
* Cherry, apple, pear, plum and other fruit trees.
* Raspberries
* Gooseberries
* carrots
* Celery
* Tomatoes
* Onions
* Leeks
* Fuchsias
* Geraniums
* Lavender
* Carnations
* Chrysanthemums

Wood ash contains:
* 25 to 45 percent quicklime (calcium oxide)
* three to six percent magnesium and potassium oxide
* two to six percent phosphorus pentoxide
* mineral trace elements (iron, manganese, boron and sodium)
Particularly suitable plants:
* Vegetable garden : tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, leeks
* Perennials and shrubs : roses, gladioli, phlox
* Flower beds : geraniums, fuchsias
* Fruit trees : grapevines, gooseberries, raspberries
* Indoor plants : all lime-tolerant plants
Tips
Let wood ash swell in water so that the fine-grained particles soak up. Then place the pot on the stove and wait for lumps of ash to form. These dissolve more slowly.
Have ashes tested
If you want to be on the safe side, you can have your ashes analyzed in a laboratory. There are quantitative tests that check the ash for ten to twelve common heavy metals. Ten grams of wood ash are sufficient for a precise analysis.
