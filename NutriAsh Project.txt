The NutriAsh initiative looks at innovative solutions to tackle waste generated from biomass, sewage sludge, and their combinations. It explores novel recovery methods to extract valuable elements from ash residues promoting resource efficiency and circularity.
Brief:
With a global population exceeding seven billion people, traditional agricultural practices are placing immense pressure on our planet's resources. This is evident in the depletion of water resources, escalating pollution levels, and extensive energy consumption. Moreover, the escalating use for artificial fertilizers and the challenge of waste management have spurred the need for sustainable solutions to utilize agricultural waste effectively. 
Urban farming is gaining traction worldwide as a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture and an opportunity to address waste management by integrating biomass ash from organic waste into fertilizer production, thereby fostering agricultural sustainability while promoting environmental conservation and community well-being. The disposal of biomass ash, a byproduct of biomass briquette production, overlooks its potential nutritional value for soil health and plant growth. As many societies transition towards more sustainable and cleaner energy sources, the use of biomass fuel has been on the rise. In Uganda, there are hundreds of briquetting units, each producing approximately 200–250 tons of briquettes, resulting in 7000 tons of briquette ash production per month.
Ash derived from biomass briquettes is rich in micronutrients essential for plant growth, such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Its application to soil not only enhances soil fertility but also raises pH levels, reducing soil acidity and improving overall soil health. Additionally, harnessing the nutritional value of biomass ash as a soil amendment not only enhances soil fertility but also contributes to environmental conservation and community health. Through these innovative approaches, we aim to promote food security while mitigating the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture.
Our motivations are centered around agricultural and environmental sustainability. By promoting organic urban agriculture and utilizing biomass resources effectively, we aim to improve access to fresh produce, create employment opportunities, and contribute to food security, particularly in rural areas where the supply of biomass feedstocks and demand for alternative energy are higher.


NutriAsh: Transforming Waste into Soil Gold
Problem Statement:
Urban farming faces significant challenges, including limited access to fertile soil and sustainable soil amendments. While biomass briquettes are a commonly used household fuel, they produce substantial amounts of ash, which is often discarded as waste. However, this ash is rich in essential nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and micronutrients crucial for plant growth.
Issue: Biomass briquettes produce significant ash waste.
Solution:
NutriAsh, a nutrient-rich soil amendment derived from Biomass ash. By harnessing the power of ash as a soil amendment, we aim to create sustainable solutions that not only improve soil health but also generate economic opportunities for communities.

Future Outlook:
We aim to develop a groundbreaking software solution tailored for ash producers, known as the NutriAsh Modelling Application (NAMA). This innovative software is designed to assess the potential utilization of various types of ashes, taking into account their unique compositions and properties. By leveraging NAMA, ash producers can accurately predict the quality of ash through real-time measurements obtained from power plants. This tool will not only streamline the ash evaluation process but also optimize ash utilization, contributing to enhanced efficiency and sustainability in biomass energy production.
Adopting a holistic approach, NutriAsh fosters collaboration across sectors including waste management, energy production, ash processing, and information technology. This cross-sector partnership facilitates the development and implementation of state-of-the-art solutions for material recovery and utilization of bio residues. Furthermore, NutriAsh integrates modern artificial intelligence (AI) into a cloud-based digital tool. This tool empowers ash producers to evaluate the quality and optimal utilization potential of their ashes, enabling informed decision-making and maximizing resource efficiency.
